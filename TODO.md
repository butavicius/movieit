## (hypothetical) TODO:

- [ ] TESTS!!!! The whole thing works on faith at the moment.
- [ ] Api configuration (like genre name to id map) is hard coded. Make sure the fresh version is loaded at every App start up.
- [ ] Move response parsing logic from DetailsScreen to data layer to make the component cleaner.
- [ ] Implement error logging and monitoring with [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) or similar.
- [ ] Implement Vimeo as a trailer video source. At the moment only trailer videos hosted on YouTube are shown.
- etc...
